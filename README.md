# MTHFR RNA-seq analysis

## Raw data and base calling quality control

The original fastq files were downloaded using the SRA Toolkit and the BioProject accession number PRJNA639365. The pair-ended reads were evaluated using FASTQC, which showed an overall high quality of the sequencing experiments (Reports).

## Read preprocessing and genome mapping

Due to the very high quality of the sequencing data, no pre-processing of the resulting reads was necessary. 

The genome mapping was performed using SALMON.
